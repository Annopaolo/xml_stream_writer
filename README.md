# XMLStreamWriter

XML streaming library for Elixir.

This library allows to write big data scale XML documents without keeping the whole document in memory.

## About This Project

This project has been created in order to export [Astarte](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte)
realms to XML.
We are open to any contribution and we encourage adoption of this library, also outside Astarte, in
order to provide XML streaming to every Elixir user.
